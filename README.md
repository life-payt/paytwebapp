# PAYT Web Application

The Web Application is served through the payt-http-server module. To update the web application, changes are made withint the webapp folder. Since it is a NodeJS application, in order to update it NodeJS has to be installed. For updating the application, if it's the first time you have to run 'npm install' and the 'npm run build'. After this all it takes is to run 'npm run build'.
